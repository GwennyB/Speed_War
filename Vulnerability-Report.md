# Vulnerability Report 

## 1 - SQL Injection
- SQL injection must be handled carefully, as concatinating SQL strings can lead to security vunerabilities. 
- In our code, we have chosen to use Lamda expressions instead of SQL statements, removing the vulnerability from our code.  

Example:  
We used:  
```
deck => deck.UserID == userID && deck.DeckType == deckType
```
Instead of:  
```
string stringQuery = "SELECT * FROM Decks WHERE UserID == " + userID + " AND DeckType == " + deckType ";
```  
  

## 2 - Weak Account Management
- Weak account management (like using non-standard encryption or informing a user on a poor login that their account password is wrong) can cause major security breaches.
- We did not have to worry about Weak Account Management as we have no protected information, or even a "real" login. Additionally, we do not create any cookies that need management.

## 4 - Insecure Direct object references
- If User doesn't insert their username and wants to start the game, it will still redirect to the game page instead of stay on the home page ask them to provide a username
- We did not ask them to create a new account, so [Require] does not work in this case, what we did is if the name string is null(user didnt put anything in the textbox) we will give them a random name which is "Default"

## 6 - Sensitive data exposure
- Sensitive data, like passwords, should be stored by hashing them. Passwords should also have enforced requirements for a stronger password. Don't let a user set "password" as a password.
- As our app has no information that needs protecting, user's do not create or utilize a password, so there is no need to hashing or additional data security. 

## 7 - Missing function level access control
- Senstive pages, such as admin dashboards or user information should be protected behind authorization. ASP-NET has many ways to authorize a user to view a page.
- Our app has no sensitive data that needs protecting. There is no user implemented database manipulation that needs to be protected from a user.

## 9 - Unvalidated redirects and forwards
- Our website only has one redirect (from home page to game page), which is mentioned at #4
